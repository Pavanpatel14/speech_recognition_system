*DOMAIN*: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION*: 4-WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH


## DESCRIPTION
   This project involves building a basic Speech-to-Text (STT) system that converts short audio clips into written text using pre-trained models. The system demonstrates the core functionality of automatic speech recognition (ASR), allowing users to input a .wav audio file and receive an accurate textual transcription.


## Features

- Upload and process multiple audio formats
- Automatic conversion to WAV format (if necessary)
- Speech-to-text transcription using Google Speech Recognition API
- Clean and interactive Streamlit interface

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-recognition-app.git
   cd speech-recognition-app
2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

  ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
  ```

2. Open your browser and go to the local URL (usually http://localhost:8501)

3. Upload an audio file in one of the supported formats.

4. The app process the first 20 secondsof the audio and returns the transcribed text.



## Supported File Types
